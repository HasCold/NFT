                            IPFS                                          HTTP
1. Content Addressing                                           Location Addressing
2. No one control it                                            Controlled by the location owner
3. Efficient                                                    Not Efficient
4. Bandwith is higher in the terms of IPFS.                     Bandwith is less performant as compared to the IPFS.
5. Immutable                                                    Mutable
6. Cannot go down because there are many nodes                  Can go down.


IPFS Node :- The machine that runs IPFS S/W to store and retrieve files from the IPFS network is called IPFS node.
